## General Information
- Project Background: Melanoma is a dangerous type of skin cancer. Early detection is important to save lives. This project aims to help doctors by automatically identifying melanoma and other skin diseases from images.
- Business Problem: Doctors currently need to manually review images to diagnose skin conditions. This takes a lot of time. The projectâ€™s goal is to create a model that can quickly and accurately classify skin images into different disease categories.

- Dataset:
- The data is from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) and contains images of 9 types of skin conditions, including melanoma.
- Some disease categories have more images than others, so data augmentation is used to create a balanced dataset.

## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.8
- TensorFlow/Keras - version 2.10
- Augmentor - version 0.2.8

<!-- As the libraries versions keep on changing, it is recommended to mention the version of library used in this project -->

## Conclusions
- Balancing the Data: Adding more images to the under-represented classes improved the model's performance.
- Data Augmentation: Using data augmentation (like rotating, flipping, and zooming images) helped the model perform better by seeing more varied examples.
- The model has potential to converge more, so increasing the number of epochs would likely lead to better results.
